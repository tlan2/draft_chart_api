# Fantasy Football Draft Tier Charts by Position
![Example](charts/qb.jpg)


A Python program that uses the Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and other libraries to create a dumbbell showing important draft information by position. Dependent on data from fantasyfootballcalculator.com's draft API. BIG Shoutout to [@nathanbraun](https://github.com/nathanbraun) and his book [Learn to Code with Fantasy Football](https://fantasycoding.com/) serving as inspiration for this project. Also thanks to my professor Kristin Tufte for her support and oversight on this project.
